<details><summary>About</summary>
  After working for three years as a construction foreman I developed a number of important skills such as multitasking and make-decision, 
  because I led a group up to thirty workers and I had to be in several places at the same time. Also, I am flexiable, adaptable to new situations.
  I am hardworking and like to learn something new.<br>
  As for my weakness, I have a fear of public speaking. But at my previous work every morning I had to give and explain tasks to a group of thirty workers. 
  Now I feel more comfortable about it.
